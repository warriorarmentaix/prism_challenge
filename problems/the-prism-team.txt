The Prism Team
--------------

The goal of this question is to write a script which will parse
the Prism 'About Us' page and spit out a list of all employees at
Prism, along with their job titles.

The Prism 'About Us' page is accessible at https://prism.com/about/

Your script should do a GET request over HTTPS to retrieve the most
recent version of the 'About Us' page. It should parse it, then print
out a list of each happy Prism employee and their title.

Example interaction:

    $ prism-about-us-scrapper
    There are 34 people on the Prism team. They are:

        Steve Russell, CEO & Founder
        Mike Fogel, VP of Engineering
        Bob Cutting, SVP of Operations
        ...

Please include a README in your submission that details:

  * how to run your script
  * why you choose the language you did
  * what the primary design decisions were in implementing your solution
    and why you made the choices you did
  * if you ran out of time, what you were hoping to do next
